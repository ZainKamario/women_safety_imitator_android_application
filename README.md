The "Women safety app" is a necessary and user-friendly mobile application designed for security and remote access. We started this app to provide a simple solution for women's safety. This research is important for a fast response. The design deals with dangerous issues, helps women feel safer, and prevents rape, harassment, and other dangerous situations. The app helps maintain gender equality and reduce crime against women by providing a safe environment. The app's purpose is to offer girls a platform to report situations, including emergency situations where the power button is used to send a message and real-time location. The app includes features such as connections to various institutions, and if the app is destroyed, it still works in the background with emergency keys that buzz for alerts.

<h1>INTRODUCTION </h1>
In the introduction, it's noted that while harassment incidents can be controlled, immediate help is also necessary. This application is designed to assist girls who experience incidents in different institutions, by simply pressing a button on their mobile device. Within seconds, an emergency message will be sent to relevant security personnel, women police, and women protection cells, along with the location. The app also allows for management of cases, including reporting and monitoring of unresolved incidents. A crucial feature is the ability for the app to run in the background and provide real-time location information, even if closed, to ensure safe locations are always known.
